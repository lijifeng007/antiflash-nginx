# Sites available

Files in this folder are not referenced/loaded automatically. The intended
purpose of this folder is to contain all server config files whether they
are currently in use or not.

So, for example this folder may contain:

	example.com
    ssl.example.com

Where each file contains the server block(s) specific to that project.
